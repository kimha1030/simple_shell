.SH EXECUTION OF COMMANDS
Initialially words are separated by blanks. The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero (arr[0]). The other words are part of the arguments and are stored. Subsequently, it is verified if the slash (/) separator exists in the simple command (arr [0]). If it exists, it indicates that the simple command contains a path name, from which the base name must be extracted.Then, it continues with the execution of the command (which can also correspond to the base name). After execution the prompt is displayed again.
