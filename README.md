# Repository for 0x16. C - Simple Shell

This project is our version of the Shell, developed for educational purposes, following the guidelines of the Holberton School.


## Description

simple_shell is a UNIX command line interpreter that allows us to enter a simple command line (input) in a terminal and obtain the corresponding output. It should be noted that the standard location of the available commands or executable files or commands is: /bin/

After compiling and executing the shell with the flags *(gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh)*, simple commands are entered and the output is verified.
